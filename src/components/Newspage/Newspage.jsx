                <b>3 main reasons why you should opt for security cameras</b>
              </h1>
              <span>
                It’s obvious that the security cameras have outdone the wired
                ones by far. In the world where every single piece of technology
                made has a wireless version, it only makes sense that security
                cameras would also make the suit. But why should you use
                wireless cameras instead of wired and what advantages do they
                have that the wired ones don’t have.
              </span>
              <span>
                Lots of advantages come with security cameras over the wired
                ones. Nevertheless, this piece discusses the three top reasons:

              <span>
                Security cameras can provide much more aesthetic value when
                compared to the wired one. This means that you don’t have to
                keep worrying about cable length and issues such as wrapping of
                wires or making sure that you have an easy access where the
                wires will kick ass through. A wireless camera system provides
                you with all the features of wired one without all such hassles.

          <h4>Accommodation</h4>
          <span>
            Accessibility is one of the biggest problems that most security
            cameras installation companies face.
          </span>
          <span>
            They can have the best set up for your business, but if the premise
            doesn’t have the right style that can accommodate the security
            camera system, then there is nothing much that the installers can do
            to help. Nevertheless, with the security cameras, installation is
            easy and can be quickly moved when need be, something which a wired
            one can not do.
          </span>
          <h4>Portability</h4>
          <span>

            These are, but a fraction of the very many benefits security cameras
            have over the wired ones. It offers a lot of things which a wired
            one can’t. Wireless security systems are comprehensive surveillance
            kits. With the devices, you are assured to keep ‘all seeing’ eye on
            whatever is happening at your home or place of business. A typical
            system would get you 4-6 security cameras which can either be
            installed indoors or outdoors. You can also use high-end systems
            that come with motion sensors and mobile feeds. This allows you to
            stream the footage over the internet in a real time environment.

            faster, it doesn’t get better than using wireless technology.

            you don’t have the required budget, don’t shy off to get a wired one
            for the time being.
